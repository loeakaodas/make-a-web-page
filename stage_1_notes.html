              There are different ways in which to think like a programmer:

          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              The World Wide Web is a collection of <span class="bold">HTML</span> documents that are linked together by <span class="bold">URLs</span> and <span class="bold">HTTP</span> across the <span class="bold">internet</span>. The Web itself was invented in the early 90's at CERN and now comprises over 30 billion pages. You
              access the web through a browser, which sends a request across the internet using HTTP to a server; a specialized computer designed to store websites. The most popular browsers are Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox.

        <div class="concept-title">HTML</div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              HTML stands for <span class="italic">Hypertext markup language</span>. An HTML document would contain all the text, markup, references, and links to other pages that a browser would interpret to present a complete webpage to an end user.
            </p>

        <div class="concept-title">Markup</div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              HTML markup consists of tags &amp; elements. A <span class="bold">tag</span> is something that can change the behavior of it's contents, for example making it <span class="bold">bold</span> or <span class="italic">italic</span>. It is important to remember to close all your tags or risk creating problems,
              there are however void tags that don't need to be closed: ex. the img or br tags. There are many different tags that do different things, you can for example <a href="http://www.udacity.com">link</a> to the Udacity homepage! And many other fun
              things as well. A complete tag comprises an element.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good thing to also remember is how <span class="italic">whitespace     </span> is treated. All tabs, new lines, or multiple spaces get translated into a single space &amp; that is why you need markup to <span class="bold">change</span> things up.

          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              Computers are very literal and logical (usually). They will take all your instructions exactly as they were written, no how they might have been intended. So it's important to follow the correct syntax when coding.

          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              HTML treats certain elements as inline and other as block. What that means is that inline elements will appear on the <span class="italic">same</span> line, while
            </p>
              <div>block elements get their own special "box" or block.</div>

          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              A web browser interprets HTML's tree-like structure (DOM-document object model) and presents it in a series of nested boxes, aligned to a grid, and according to the rules that HTML's DOM has established.

            <p>
              Chrome's Dev Tools will show you how a page is structured and allow you to manipulate and instantly see the results on the page. They also demonstrate how the different indentation of the HTML document transforms the element into a hierarchy of nested
              boxes.

          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              By utilizing CSS you can reduce the complexity &amp; repetition of having to edit individual sections of HTML in order to change how it looks in the browser. Instead you just apply the desired style with CSS &amp; as a result it can be easily changed whenever necessary  without having to edit the HTML extensively or at all.

              Once you have your code complete it is important to validate it using the W3C validation tools for <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">HTML</a> &amp; <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">CSS</a> so that you can find mistakes that might make the pages appear differently on different browsers and find out if you are conforming to the HTML5 standard or not in your code.
